Things that need doing.

1.  If we're going to change the relation name COMMENT to REVIEW, go back and update the implementation data model (and maybe the EER diagram) accordingly.

2.  Confirm how we want to handle time and date attributes.  Preference is to make them all DATE types and ignore time of day.  If we want to do that, a few attributes names should change for readability (i.e. InquiryTime, PaymentTime).  Changes needed in both EER diagram, implementation data model, and relations table.

2.  Confirm that none of the existing relations are anything less than BCNF.  Especially think about the EMPLOYEE relation, but appears to be the case.

3.  Review the Relations_Table spreadsheet for correctness, especially data types and constraints.  Confirm changes from items 1,2 above.

4.  Review Database_Creation script for correct order of creation with respect to the foreign keys, and given changes from items 1,2,3 above.

5.  Add to Database_Creation script any necessary referential actions on foreign keys, such as ON DELETE CASCADE.

6.  Add to Database_Creation script any necessary CHECK statements to enforce data type integrity rules.  e.g. employees must be 18 years old.

7.  Review sql view scripts, especially any assumptions listed at top of each.

8.  Review sql query scripts, especially any assumptions listed at top of each.
